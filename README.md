# Slidding-Puzzles


Found some mini projects on Medium website for mini HTML, CSS and JavaScript projects....

Most these prjoects are standard using 
index.html
styles.css
scripts.js

I did tweak some of these projects either because of my versions differ of some of the formating of browser control, or the HTML was yet to be formated and made it my own on all these projects... I will credit the source and give links to the Medium article and the orignal source coder

Open source projefts are fun and can learn from them
